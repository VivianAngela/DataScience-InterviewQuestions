### Q. In TensorFlow, what exactly Bias and Variance are? Do you find any similarity of difference between them?
In the learning algorithms, Bias are generally considered as errors that declare their presence due to overly assumptions. These can sometimes result in failure of entire model and can largely affect the accuracy also in several cases. Some experts believe these errors are essential to enable leaner’s gain knowledge from a training point of view. On the other side, Variance is another problem that comes when the learning algorithm is quite complex. Therefore a limit is to be imposed on this.

### Q. When will you find overfit condition of your model in TensorFlow?
There are variations in the training data or data that needs to be verified through TensorFlow. If the variations are very large in the data, probably it could lead to this problem. The best possible solution is to remove the noise from the available data upto the possible extent. 

### Q. What exactly do you know about Bias-Variance decomposition?
It is generally used to decompose problems such as errors that occur during learning in different algorithms. Bias keeps reducing if the data is to be made complex. Trading off the Variance and Bias are very essential to get results that are totally free from errors. 

### Q. Are you familiar with a Fourier Transform?
Well, it is a mathematical concept. Basically, it is a generic method that is used for decomposing the generic functions into a superposition of other functions that are generally symmetric in nature. When it comes to finding the speeds of cycles and amplitudes, they are widely adopted in the machine learning. Fourier Transformation is also used for solving some of the very complex problems of mathematics.

### Q. How k-means clustering is different from KNN?
K-means clustering is basically an unsupervised clustering algorithm. It is capable to tolerate some minor errors. On the other side, the KNN is structured clustering algorithm. For reliable operations, it should be accurate and reliable. The mechanism for both seems very similar at the first glance but users need to label the data in the KNN which is not required in the k-means clustering. 

### Q. What exactly do you know about a ROC curve and its working?
IT is basically used to reflect something very important regarding the rates which are classified as true positive rates and false positive rates. It represents all the information in the form of graphs. Basically, it can be used as a proxy for the trade-off operations related to different algorithms.

### Q. Compare general computers with artificial neural networks?
The artificial neural network’s information source is examples that are common in general computers. It is very necessary to choose the examples carefully as they need to be given as input to the artificial neural network. Predicting the artificial neural network outcome is not an easy job but it can be trusted for its accuracy. However, the outcomes of general computers are already well-defined and can easily be predicted.

### Q. What exactly do you know about Recall and Precision
The other name of Recall is true positive rate. Actually, it is the overall figure of positiveness a model generally claim. Precision is generally regarded as the predictive value which is positive in nature.

This dataset is not a randomly distributed data and thus the standard techniques such as k-folds cannot be applied. Therefore a pattern based technique would be useful here and this is because it makes sure that all the sub-tasks flow in a well-defined sequence. There are no chances of any errors that can be considered as a chronological order that creates issues related to the functionality of the model.

### Q. In which situation the ensemble approach is useful?
In a model, there is a need to use multiple learning algorithms. This situation needs ensemble approach. In addition to this, there can also be a need to combine an applied part of learning algorithms for the optimization or the predictive performance. One of the primary aim to use this approach is to impose a limit on the overfitting. 

### Q. How can you make sure that overfitting situation is not arriving with a model you are using?
Users need to make sure that their model is simple and is not having any complex statement. All the variance should be taken into the account and the noise should be eliminated from the model data. Cross-validation technique like k-fold is another useful method that is helpful in this matter. LASSO technique is another possible solution to this issue. 

### Q. What exactly do you know about Kernel Trick?
All the kernel functions are involved in this trick basically. These tricks are useful to perform some advanced calculations. It is possible for the users to express these functions in terms of products. Also, different algorithms can be made run effectively. the good thing is this can be done even if the dimensional data is low. 

### Q. What if a file is corrupted or missing in a dataset?
It is possible to replace them with other values that run parallel to them. Dropna and isnull are the two methods that are useful in this matter. In some special cases, it is even possible to replace them with desired values and have an error-free outcome. 

### Q. What differences will you find in an array and a linked list?
Collection of objects in a well-defined order is generally considered as an array. On the other side, a linked list is also a set of objects but they are not always necessary to be well-defined or remain in a sequence. Also, they have a pointer which is missing in case of an array.
